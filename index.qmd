# üå≤ Random Forest Challenge - The Power of Weak Learners

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Challenge Requirements In [Student Analysis Section](#student-analysis-section)

Navigate to the [Student Analysis Section](#student-analysis-section) to see the challenge requirements.

:::

## The Problem: Can Many Weak Learners Beat One Strong Learner?

**Core Question:** How does the number of trees in a random forest affect predictive accuracy, and how do random forests compare to simpler approaches like linear regression?

**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are "weak learners" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a "strong learner" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?

**Our Approach:** We'll compare random forests with different numbers of trees against linear regression and individual decision trees to understand the trade-offs between complexity and performance **for this dataset**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## Data and Methodology

We analyze the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Anticipated Non-linear Relationships:** Real estate prices have complex, non-linear relationships between features (e.g., square footage in wealthy vs. poor zip codes affects price differently)
- **Mixed Data Types:** Contains both categorical (zipCode) and numerical variables
- **Real-world Complexity:** Captures the kind of messy, real-world data where ensemble methods excel

Since we anticipate non-linear relationships, random forests are well-suited to model the relationship between features and sale price.

## Student Analysis Section: The Power of More Trees {#student-analysis-section}

**Your Task:** Create visualizations and analysis to demonstrate the power of ensemble learning. You'll need to create three key components:

### 1. The Power of More Trees Visualization

**Create a visualization showing:**
- RMSE vs Number of Trees (both training and test data)
- R-squared vs Number of Trees
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization

**Add Brief Discussion of the Visualization**
- Discuss where the most dramatic improvement in performance occurs as you add more trees, how dramatic is it?
- Discuss diminishing returns as you add more trees

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Visualization Requirements

Create two plots:
1. **RMSE Plot:** Show how RMSE decreases with more trees (both training and test)
2. **R-squared Plot:** Show how R-squared increases with more trees

Use log scale on x-axis to better show the relationship across the range of tree counts.
:::

### 2. Overfitting Visualization and Analysis

**Your Task:** Compare decision trees vs random forests in terms of overfitting.

**Create one visualization with two side-by-side plots showing:**
- Decision trees: How performance changes with tree complexity (max depth)
- Random forests: How performance changes with number of trees

**Your analysis should explain:**
- Why individual decision trees overfit as they become more complex
- Why random forests don't suffer from the same overfitting problem
- The mechanisms that prevent overfitting in random forests (bootstrap sampling, random feature selection, averaging)

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Overfitting Analysis Requirements

Create a side-by-side comparison showing:
1. **Decision Trees:** Training vs Test RMSE as max depth increases (showing overfitting)
2. **Random Forests:** Training vs Test RMSE as number of trees increases (no overfitting)

- Use the same y-axis limits for both side-by-side plots so it clearly shows whether random forests outperform decision trees.
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization
:::

### 3. Linear Regression vs Random Forest Comparison

**Your Task:** Compare random forests to linear regression baseline.

**Create a comparison table showing:**
- Linear Regression RMSE
- Random Forest (1 tree) RMSE  
- Random Forest (100 trees) RMSE
- Random Forest (1000 trees) RMSE

**Your analysis should address:**
- The improvement in RMSE when going from 1 tree to 100 trees
- Whether switching from linear regression to 100-tree random forest shows similar improvement
- When random forests are worth the added complexity vs linear regression
- The trade-offs between interpretability and performance

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Comparison Requirements

Create a clear table comparing:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest (1 tree)
- Random Forest (100 trees) 
- Random Forest (1000 trees)

Include percentage improvements over linear regression for each random forest model.

*Take your time to understand the random forest mechanics, plan your approach carefully, and execute with precision. Rushing through this challenge will only lead to errors and confusion.*
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## üíæ Important: Save Your Work Frequently!

**Before you start:** Make sure to commit your work often using the Source Control panel in Cursor (Ctrl+Shift+G or Cmd+Shift+G). This prevents the AI from overwriting your progress and ensures you don't lose your work.

**Commit after each major step:**

- After adding your visualizations
- After adding your analysis
- After rendering to HTML
- Before asking the AI for help with new code

**How to commit:**

1. Open Source Control panel (Ctrl+Shift+G)
2. Stage your changes (+ button)
3. Write a descriptive commit message
